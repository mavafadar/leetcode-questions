## 3Sum Closest

Given an integer array `numbers` of length `n` and an integer `target`, find three integers in `numbers` such that the sum is closest to `target`.

Return the sum of the three integers.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

## Examples

### Example 1
```
Input: numbers = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```

### Example 2
```
Input: numbers = [0,0,0], target = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 0. (0 + 0 + 0 = 0).
```

### Constraints
- `3 <= numbers.length <= 500`
- `-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000`
- `-10^4 <= targer <= 10^4`
